# Adaptive Sociopolitical Environment Simulator

A sophisticated simulation system that models and analyzes sociopolitical environments, focusing on policy impacts, population dynamics, and economic factors.

## Overview

This project simulates a sociopolitical environment with a focus on the United Kingdom, allowing for the analysis of various policies and their impacts on different population segments. The simulator incorporates complex interactions between policies, population demographics, and economic factors to provide insights into potential outcomes of policy decisions.

## Features

- **Population Simulation**: Generates and manages a detailed population model
- **Policy Analysis**: Evaluates the impact of various policies on different population segments
- **Economic Modeling**: Simulates economic factors and their interactions with policies
- **Data Extraction**: Processes and analyzes real-world data for simulation inputs
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface for interacting with the simulation
- **Training System**: Machine learning components for policy optimization

## Project Structure

- `config.py`: Core configuration settings and initialization
- `simulation.py`: Main simulation engine
- `policy.py`: Policy implementation and analysis
- `people_generation.py`: Population generation and management
- `data_extraction.py`: Data processing and analysis
- `training.py`: Machine learning components
- `GUI.py`: User interface implementation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (to be listed in requirements.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dannychantszfong/Adaptive-Sociopolitical-Environment-Simulator.git
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the GUI interface:
```bash
python GUI.py
```

2. Configure simulation parameters through the interface
3. Run simulations and analyze results

## Key Components

### Simulation Engine
The core simulation engine (`simulation.py`) handles the main simulation logic, including:
- Population dynamics
- Policy implementation
- Economic calculations
- Time progression

### Policy System
The policy system (`policy.py`) manages:
- Policy creation and modification
- Impact analysis
- Policy optimization
- Historical policy tracking

### Population Management
The population system (`people_generation.py`) handles:
- Population generation
- Demographic distribution
- Individual characteristics
- Population evolution
